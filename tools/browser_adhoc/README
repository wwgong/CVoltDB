The browser_adhoc application is an adhoc query tool that runs from a web browser.  When running, the "server" will accept adhoc query requests for a single VoltDB database from all client machines.

This example requires Python.

At the top of the main file (browser_adhoc.py), modify the following parameters for your environment:

  # volt server IP address and port
  volt_server_ip = 'localhost'
  volt_server_port = 21212

  # volt username/password if database security is enabled
  volt_username = ''
  volt_password = ''

  # port on local server to listen for http requests, URL is formatted as http://localhost:9001 
  http_server_port = 9001


To run the application execute the following:

  python browser_adhoc.py


To stop the application press Control-C in the terminal window where the above command was executed.
