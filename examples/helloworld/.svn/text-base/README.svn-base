This directory contains the source files for the Hello, World! tutorial described in _Getting Started with VoltDB_. 

The tutorial is designed to familiarize you with the source code and the commands needed to write and compile VoltDB applications, so we suggest you try issuing the commands yourself. However, an Ant build.xml file is provided as well for those who just want to see the example in action.

The commands to process these files (not using Ant) are the following:

  $ export CLASSPATH=.:../../voltdb/*

  $ javac Client.java
  $ javac Insert.java
  $ javac Select.java

        (compile application catalog)

  $ java org.voltdb.compiler.VoltCompiler project.xml helloworld.jar

        (create database)

  $ java -Djava.library.path=../../voltdb/ org.voltdb.VoltDB catalog helloworld.jar deployment deployment.xml

        (in a separate window, set default to the helloworld sample directory
         then set the class path and run the client application)

  $ export CLASSPATH=.:../../voltdb/*
  $ java Client
