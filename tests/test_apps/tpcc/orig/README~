TPC_B for VoltDB and CVoltDB, as of 1/26/13

Sources: set up for CVoltdb here.
To run with VoltDB:
Copy everything to another directory
Replace tpcbprocedures:
rm -r src/com/tpcbprocedures
mv src1/com/tpcbprocedures src/com

If using Voltdb 3.0, change src/com/TPCCLoader.java's import of org.voltdb.Pair
   to import of org.voltcore.Pair

To run with Voltdb or CVoltdb at ../spot

To run server:
Single Host: uses deployment.xml
bash run_tpcbx.sh spot catalog      for Voltdb server
or
bash run_tpcbx.sh spot catalog-cv   for CVoltdb server
bash run_tpcbx.sh spot server > server.log   (either server)

Multihost: uses mh_deployment.xml
--Check host ids in run_tpcbmh.sh
bash run_tpcbmh.sh spot catalog      for Voltdb server
or
bash run_tpcbmh.sh spot catalog-cv   for CVoltdb server
bash run_tpcbmh.sh spot server > server.log   (either server)

To run client with 15% MP:
Single host
bash run_tpcbx.sh spot 15 > client.log    (space needed between 5 and >)

Multiple hosts
bash run_tpcbmh.sh spot 15 > client.log   (space needed between 5 and >)

TPC-C: so far, only run_tpcc.sh, like run_tpcbx.sh, but doesn't
load items when run with release servers, and crashes earlier
with debug servers.
