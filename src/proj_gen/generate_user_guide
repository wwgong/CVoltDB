% Skeleton Project Guide

A skeleton project can be created by running the "generate" script. An
example skeleton project, like that generated, is available in the
examples/skeleton/ directory. The skeleton project includes all the files
needed to build and run a simple database and demonstrates the basic
components of the system; the ddl.sql file, which is used to create the
database; the project.xml file, which defines the procedures the system will
load; the procedure files, which define the example SQL stored procedures
(Delete.java, Insert.java, and Select.java); the client java code
(Client.java); and build.xml, the ant build script used to build the
database, run the DB server, and build and run the client.

To build the example skeleton project:

- in a terminal window, run ant (no target) to compile the Java and skeleton
  catalog
- then run ant server, to start the VOLT DB server
- then, in a separate terminal window, run ant client, where you will see
  the results
- when complete, hit Ctrl C in the server terminal window to exit VOLT DB
